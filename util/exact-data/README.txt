The *_full.csv files in these directories contain all
the useful information extracted from the exact
database. This contains stuff like whether an account is
a liability, of it should be on the profit/loss
statement etc.

The _minimal.csv files contain only the information
necessary to make a correct import in the lisp
implementation.
